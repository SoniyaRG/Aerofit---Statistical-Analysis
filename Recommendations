Recommendations :
1.Target Marketing: Continue promoting KP281 as an entry-level option with broad appeal, highlighting its balanced gender distribution and moderate price. Position KP481 as a slightly premium choice appealing to both genders, while KP781 should be marketed as a high-end product targeting males with advanced features and high-mileage needs.
2.Customer Targeting: Focus on customers aged 24-33 with 16 years of education and offer special promotions for partnered customers, who show greater interest in purchasing. Address high-income and high-mileage users by offering tailored solutions or premium options to meet their specific needs.
